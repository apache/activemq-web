[Artemis](https://activemq.apache.org/artemis/) is the codename used for the HornetQ code that was donated to the Apache Foundation.

It is possible that Artemis will eventually become the successor to ActiveMQ 5.x (and that it might eventually be branded as ActiveMQ 6.x), but no decision about that had been made as of April 2015 as documented in that month's [ActiveMQ Board Report](http://activemq.apache.org/apache-activemq-board-report-201504-april.html).
