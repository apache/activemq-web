It is very common for an organisation to have lots of legacy C code which needs integration into the message bus. The current available solutions are

*   [CMS](#) is an easy-to-use JMS 1.1-like API for C++. Our implementation of CMS is called ActiveMQ-CPP, the architecture for which supports pluggable transport protocols, very much like the ActiveMQ broker itself.
*   use the [OpenWire C Client](Connectivity/Cross Language Clients/C Integration/openwire-c-client.md) which is only available in ActiveMQ 4.x or later.
*   we are working on the [OpenWire CPP Client](Connectivity/Cross Language Clients/ActiveMQ C++ ClientsConnectivity/Cross Language Clients/ActiveMQ C++ Clients/Connectivity/Cross Language Clients/ActiveMQ C++ Clients/openwire-cpp-client.md)

*   use the [Stomp C Client](http://stomp.codehaus.org/C) for any version of ActiveMQ from 3.1 onwards. You can also use [Stomp](http://stomp.codehaus.org/) from many other languages like .Net, Python, Ruby, Perl etc.

Other alternative mechanisms to communicate using.

*   use the [REST](Connectivity/ProtocolsConnectivity/Protocols/Connectivity/Protocols/rest.md) API
*   use [WS-Notification](http://servicemix.org/WS+Notification) and generate C bindings to WS-Notification using a SOAP stack
*   use [.Net or Mono](Community/FAQ/Using Apache ActiveMQ/how-do-i-access-activemq-from-csharp-or-dotnet.md) to use ActiveMQ insided .Net
*   [Compile ActiveMQ with GCJ](Connectivity/Cross Language Clients/C Integration/compile-activemq-with-gcj.md) to get a native C/C++ library
*   link to the ActiveMQ Java client using JNI
*   Use a Jabber client to talk to the ActiveMQ broker via the [XMPP](Connectivity/Protocols/xmpp.md) protocol
