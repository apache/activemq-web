There are some similarities between the two; they both support JMS 1.1 and run inside [JBoss 4.x](Connectivity/ContainersConnectivity/Containers/Connectivity/Containers/jboss-integration.md).

However ActiveMQ does offer some specific differences and advantages (at least from our perspective)

*   ActiveMQ works great in any JVM not just inside the JBoss application server
*   ActiveMQ comes complete with a large number of [Cross Language Clients](Connectivity/cross-language-clients.md)
*   ActiveMQ supports many different [Protocols](ConnectivityConnectivity/Connectivity/protocols.md) such as [Ajax](Connectivity/ajax.md), [REST](Connectivity/ProtocolsConnectivity/Protocols/Connectivity/Protocols/rest.md), [Stomp](Connectivity/Protocols/stomp.md), [OpenWire](Connectivity/Protocols/openwire.md), [XMPP](Connectivity/Protocols/xmpp.md)
*   ActiveMQ supports a large number of advanced features like [Message Groups](Features/Consumer FeaturesFeatures/Consumer Features/Features/Consumer Features/message-groups.md), [Exclusive Consumer](Features/Consumer Features/exclusive-consumer.md), [Composite Destinations](Features/Destination Features/composite-destinations.md), [Advisory Message](Features/Message FeaturesFeatures/Message Features/Features/Message Features/advisory-message.md) support
*   ActiveMQ supports reliable connections with [configurable](Using ActiveMQ/configuring-transports.md) automatic reconnection
*   ActiveMQ has great [Spring Support](Connectivity/Containers/spring-Community/support.md)
*   ActiveMQ supports distributed destinations across networks
*   ActiveMQ is very fast; often 10x faster than JBossMQ.

Performance guides
------------------

If you're not convinced by performance reports then please do try running performance tests yourself. You might wanna check out our overview of [Performance](FeaturesFeatures/Features/performance.md) or try using out the [ActiveMQ Performance Module Users Manual](Features/Performance/activemq-performance-module-users-manual.md)

The Commercial Providers on the [Support](CommunityCommunity/Community/support.md) page may also be able to help diagnose performance issues, suggest changes, etc...
