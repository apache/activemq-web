The [Apache Camel](http://camel.apache.org) project has been designed to work easily with ActiveMQ - and comes [embedded](http://activemq.apache.org/camel/how-does-camel-work-with-activemq.html) in both the clients and the broker from ActiveMQ 5.0 onwards.

[Apache Camel](http://camel.apache.org) supports an extensive range of [integration patterns](http://camel.apache.orgFeatures/enterprise-integration-patterns.md) to make integration very simple!

**It also supports a wide range of [transport binding components](http://camel.apache.org/components.html)**
