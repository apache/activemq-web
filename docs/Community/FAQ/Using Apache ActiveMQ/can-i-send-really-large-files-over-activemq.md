Can I send really large files over ActiveMQ
-------------------------------------------

The answer is yes.

If you are using ActiveMQ 4.2 or later we highly recommend you use [Blob Messages](Features/Message Features/blob-messages.md) which implements an out of band transport of the messages; it allows the files to be hosted on external http/ftp sites if required and can support either direct publisher <-> subscriber communication or publisher -> broker/file server -> consumer messaging.

For 4.1 or ealier large file transfer is achieved using [JMS Streams](Features/Message FeaturesFeatures/Message Features/Features/Message Features/jms-streams.md).

Normally the JMS API expects the entire JMS messsage to reside in the client side memory; however using [Blob Messages](Features/Message Features/blob-messages.md) or [JMS Streams](Features/Message FeaturesFeatures/Message Features/Features/Message Features/jms-streams.md) allows you to send and receive arbitrarily large files with very low RAM overhead.
