How do I get started with JMS
-----------------------------

Your best way to get started understanding the JMS API is [Sun's JMS tutorial](http://java.sun.com/j2ee/1.4/docs/tutorial/doc/JMS.html#wp84181).

Alternatively you could stick to writing business level POJOs and hide the middleware via [Apache Camel](http://activemq.apache.org/camel/) which hides the JMS API from you letting you focus on your business logic via the [Bean Integration](http://activemq.apache.org/camel/bean-integration.html)
