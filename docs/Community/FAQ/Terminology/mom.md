Message Orientated Middleware. The art of building distributed systems using mostly asynchronous message passing with loosely coupled services consuming and emitting messages. So this includes JMS providers and message brokers.

Typically MOMs can handle any specific service instance being down for some time, so that they provide loose coupling across time, space, location, platform and language.
