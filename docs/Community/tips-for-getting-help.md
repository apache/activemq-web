[Community](community.md) > [Tips for getting help](CommunityCommunity/Community/tips-for-getting-help.md)


We are a community based open source project and we really welcome and value your [Contributions](CommunityCommunity/Community/contributing.md). We have various ways of getting help via the [Discussion Forums](CommunityCommunity/Community/discussion-forums.md) or [Mailing Lists](Community/mailing-lists.md).

Here are a few tips to help us to help you

*   which version of ActiveMQ are you using? (and if you are using a SNAPSHOT, which date?)
*   are you using queues or topics and are you using persistent or non persistent messaging?
*   details of your environment can help too such as
    *   operating system
    *   JVM version (1.6, 1.5, or 1.4)
    *   application server; spring, tomcat, J2EE etc?
*   remember you can always get full [commercial support](CommunityCommunity/Community/support.md) if you want a dedicated support team.
