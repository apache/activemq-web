How to Help
-----------

Everyone in the ActiveMQ community can help with releases; users, developers, commmiters are all encouraged to test out a release and post any comments to the [activemq-dev@ mailing list](Community/mailing-lists.md) or create a [JIRA](https://issues.apache.org/activemq/browse/AMQ) issue.

ActiveMQ is available in both source and binary distributions. See [Getting Started](Using ActiveMQUsing ActiveMQ/Using ActiveMQ/getting-started.md).
