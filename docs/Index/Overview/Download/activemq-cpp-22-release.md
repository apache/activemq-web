New and Noteworthy
------------------

This release has seen a large restructuring of the codebase to separate out to platform code into a new package called decaf. We are now making use of the APR and APR-Util libraries for platform independence. Also many new tests and bug fixes have made their way into this release.

Some notable new features in this release

*   CmsTemplate - Similar to Spring's JmsTemplate.
*   Prefetch of size zero now supported.
*   The URI can now contain environment variables.

  

**NOTE:** Compatable with ActiveMQ Broker versions in the 4.0 and 5.0 family
