New and Noteworthy
------------------

This is a patch release that addresses issues with the 3.2.2 release. This release fixes an additional issue found in unmarshaling MapMessage objects on Windows as well as fixing a threading issue that causes invalid client Ids to be generated if two connections were created from two different threads at the same time. Also a fix to the pkg-config file that is generated for the build was added.

  

**NOTE:** Compatible with ActiveMQ Broker versions in the 4.X and 5.X family
