How to Become a Committer on the ActiveMQ Project
=================================================

This page is under active development so the ideas here are very fluid right now.

As outlined on [How It Works document](http://www.apache.org/foundation/how-it-works.html) and the [ASF roles](https://www.apache.org/foundation/how-it-works.html#roles) defined there, we want to actively encourage folks to move from being contributors to the ActiveMQ TLP toward becoming full-fledged committers on the project.In an effort to provide more transparency on what it takes to become a committer on the ActiveMQ project, we are assembling our thoughts here. As we work through the identification of the skills and values we feel are necessary to become a committer on the ActiveMQ project, we should continue to discuss our thoughts on the dev@activemq mailing list so that everyone is able to participate. 

Below is the list of some of the guidelines we believe make up a good candidate for being offered committership:

*   Demonstrated ability to contribute patches/pull requests to ActiveMQ projects 
*   Demonstrated participation in discussions on the ActiveMQ mailing lists 
*   Willingness to contribute to the documentation
*   Willingness to mentor and be mentored
*   Helping to promote the community and this project, including outside of Apache
*   Sustained interest and contribution
