*   As the number and scope of the recent releases shows, there is a lot of development occurring throughout all of the ActiveMQ products 
*   Many bugs are being raised, but they are being looked at fairly promptly 
*   There were a couple of bugs raised that resulted in good “cross team” discussions as to whether the bug was, indeed, a bug or a desired change in behavior
