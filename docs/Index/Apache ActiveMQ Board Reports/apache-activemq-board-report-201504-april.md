TLP Description:  
Apache ActiveMQ is a popular and powerful open source messaging server. Apache ActiveMQ is fast, supports many Cross Language Clients and Protocols, comes with easy to use Enterprise Integration Patterns and many advanced features while fully supporting JMS 1.1 and J2EE 1.4.

Community:  
\* The development and user lists continue to stay active.  
\* Several ActiveMQ based presentation were given at Apachecon NA.  
\* The ActiveMQ community has voted to name the HortnetQ code donation ActiveMQ Artemis.  
\* Apache board members requested a special report to address what the plan is of the hornetq code donation.  There were some specific question what were directed at the PMC:

    Q. Red Hat has a product, called HornetQ, which includes a website;  
         branding, etc.  [http://hornetq.jboss.org/](http://hornetq.jboss.org/)  
  
    A. ActiveMQ PMC does not intend to use the HornetQ branding in any code,  
        docs or website. The code donation has been updated to remove such  
        references. The HornetQ open source project is now considered a legacy  
 project and the code is no longer maintained as the open source project  
 HornetQ. The ActiveMQ community is beginning to work together to   
        develop a plan to take the donated code base forward and to develop  
 community around this code base.   
  
    Q. The ActiveMQ PMC needs to deliver a plan for:  
A.  Apache ActiveMQ has multiple products with multiple versions:  
 a.  ActiveMQ - (version 5.x.x)  
 b.  ActiveMQ Artemis \- (version 1.x.x)

          This means that we are not yet ready to declare that ActiveMQ Artemis is the successor to ActiveMQ 5.x.  We will wait until the product matures to make that decision.  
  
Q. The current chair has been the chair for \*many\* years and based on the  
current status and issues in the community, I would strongly suggest having  
a plan for potentially replacing the chair of the project.

    A. The PMC agrees.

\* The PMC has voted to give the code donation a code name so that it is not referred to as HornetQ anymore within ActiveMQ.  
\* IP clearance for the code donation is almost complete: [http://incubator.apache.org/ip-clearance/hornetq.html  
](http://incubator.apache.org/ip-clearance/hornetq.html)* At least one member of the PMC, as well as several members of the community, feels strongly that disagreements and concerns are not getting addressed.  They would rather have Artemis go through the incubator.   
\* PMC is in discussions looking for ways to increase community diversity  
\* PMC has voted to appoint Bruce Snyder as the ActiveMQ PMC chair.  The PMC requests that the board approve the the following resolution:
