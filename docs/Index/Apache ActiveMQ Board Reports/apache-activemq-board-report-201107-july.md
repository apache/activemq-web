Community:

*   The development and user lists continue to stay active.
*   No new committers or PMC members added.

Development:

*   Development has started on the next ActiveMQ 5.6 release.
*   Apollo 1.0 is approaching completion. Several betas have been released and it has shown to be stable and easy to manage. The Apollo messaging engine will likely be the path used to implement ActiveMQ 6.0.

Trademark / Branding Status:

*   activemq.apache.org has been updated to follow the trademark guidelines
*   The activemq.org and activemq.com TLD's are owned by other entities
