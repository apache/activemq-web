Status report for the Apache ActiveMQ Project
=============================================

Community:
 \* The ActiveMQ project has had another very busy but quiet quarter.
 \* The development and user lists continue to stay vibrant.
 \* The Camel sub project has completed moving to a TLP.

Development:
 \* ActiveMQ 5.3.x development is underway.  Several new ideas are being researched like a new storage implementation 
   and a protocol buffer based wire encoding.  If accepted into the main line this may bump up the major version to
   6.0.
