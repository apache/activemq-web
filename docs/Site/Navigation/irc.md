Apache ActiveMQ ™ -- IRC 

[Site](site.md) > [Navigation](Site/navigation.md) > [IRC](Site/Navigation/irc.md)


Committers and contributors can often be found hanging out in IRC. Below is the information about the channel that we use: 

**Server:** irc.freenode.net

**Channel:** #apache-activemq

There are many [IRC clients](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comparison_of_Internet_Relay_Chat_clients) available out there depending on the operating system you are using. 

Note the IRC channel on codehaus is deprecated as of April 2015; please refrain from using that room.  Likewise, be aware there is a channel named #activemq on the freenode server - please avoid it as well.
