The [Apache ActiveMQ Project](http://activemq.apache.org) is pleased to announce the availability of Apollo 1.4. ActiveMQ Apollo is a faster, more reliable, easier to maintain messaging broker built from the foundations of the original ActiveMQ.

This release fixes several bugs especially around Openwire and WebSockets and introduces a few improvements like:

*   \[APLO-206\] - Load balance of job queues when 'credit:1,0' is used on the consumer.
*   \[APLO-212\] - Allow topic deletion via the REST API
