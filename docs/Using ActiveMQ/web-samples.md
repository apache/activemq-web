Apache ActiveMQ ™ -- Web Samples 

[Using ActiveMQ](using-activemq.md) > [Web Samples](Using ActiveMQ/web-samples.md)


There are a few example programs demonstrating the [REST](Connectivity/ProtocolsConnectivity/Protocols/Connectivity/Protocols/rest.md), [Ajax](Connectivity/ajax.md) and [WebSockets](ConnectivityConnectivity/Connectivity/websockets.md) messaging that comes with the ActiveMQ distribution.

Up until version 5.8 web demos were included in the default configuration and could be accessed directly using [http://localhost:8161/demo](http://localhost:8161/demo) url after starting the broker.

From 5.8 onwards, demos are excluded from default configuration. To start a broker with web examples, use `activemq-demo.xml` configuration file, like

bin/activemq console xbean:examples/conf/activemq-demo.xml
