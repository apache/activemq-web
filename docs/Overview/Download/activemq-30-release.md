[Overview](overview.md) > [Download](OverviewOverview/Overview/download.md) > [ActiveMQ 3.0 Release](Overview/Download/activemq-30-release.md)


New and Noteworthy
------------------

This new release includes the following

*   a new 'discovery' transport [protocol](FeaturesFeatures/Features/uri-Connectivity/protocols.md) for a pure client-only peer network - a self discovering cluster which automatically finds the brokers available on the network (as opposed to the 'peer' protocol which is a complete peer based JMS network).
*   migrated from the org.activemq to org.activemq package name hierarchy
*   improved support for more JDBC databases for persistence
*   an optimised wire protocol (which is unfortunately not compatible with 2.x)
*   more test cases and fixes of the [JCA Container](Connectivity/Containers/jca-container.md)
*   various performance enhancements and bug fixes
