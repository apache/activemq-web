Apache ActiveMQ ™ -- Unix Service 

[Features](features.html) > [Unix](unix.html) > [Unix Service](unix-service.html)


This page contained a very basic procedure to create a unix service for activemq.

Due to the fact that ActiveMQ contains a very functional init script - this is not needed anymore.

**Review the documentation of the init script: [Unix Shell Script](unix-shell-script.html)**
