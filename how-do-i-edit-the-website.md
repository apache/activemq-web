Apache ActiveMQ ™ -- How do I edit the website 

[Community](community.html) > [FAQ](faq.html) > [General](general.html) > [How do I edit the website](how-do-i-edit-the-website.html)


The website is all contained on a Wiki so that anyone can [contribute](contributing.html)

### How to edit

You can also click the **edit** button when viewing the website which is located on the bottom of each page.

Spam Prevention

We have been attacked by spammers so we are running a spam-avoiding scheme. So you have to ask to be added to the editing group of Confluence. This is quick and easy to do.

Just send a quick mail to the [Discussion Forums](discussion-forums.html) giving details of your confluence username and we can grant you the necessary editing karma.

Note that after you've changed the wiki it is immediately rendered on the [http://cwiki.apache.org/ACTIVEMQ/](http://cwiki.apache.org/ACTIVEMQ/) site so you can test it out; then up to an hour or two later it is updated on the Apache site.

### How the site works

There are a few special pages; for example the [Navigation](navigation.html) page is the left hand navigation bar and the [QuickLinks](quicklinks.html) is the top right navigation bar.

Other useful [links](site.html) are

*   [Banner](banner.html)
*   [Navigation](navigation.html)
*   [QuickLinks](quicklinks.html)
*   [SiteIndex](siteindex.html)
*   [SiteMap](sitemap.html)
