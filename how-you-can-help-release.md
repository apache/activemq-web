How to Help
-----------

Everyone in the ActiveMQ community can help with releases; users, developers, commmiters are all encouraged to test out a release and post any comments to the [activemq-dev@ mailing list](mailing-lists.html) or create a [JIRA](https://issues.apache.org/activemq/browse/AMQ) issue.

ActiveMQ is available in both source and binary distributions. See [Getting Started](getting-started.html).
