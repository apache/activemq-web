The form provides instructions for its completion and submittal to the Secretary of the ASF.

You can check to see if your preferred id is already taken by browsing the following list of ASF committers:

[http://people.apache.org/committer-index.html](http://people.apache.org/committer-index.html)

When your ICLA is recognized by the Secretary, you will receive a follow-up message with the next steps for establishing you as a committer.

We look forward to your response!
