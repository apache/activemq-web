Getting Help
------------

If you are experiencing problems using ActiveMQ then please report your problem to our [Issue Tracker](http://issues.apache.org/activemq/browse/AMQ). You may also find it useful to discuss your issues with the community on the [Discussion Forums](discussion-forums.html) or join one of our [Mailing Lists](mailing-lists.html).

*   [Issue Tracker](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/AMQ)
*   [Discussion Forums](discussion-forums.html)
*   [Mailing Lists](mailing-lists.html)
*   [FAQ](faq.html)

### How to get help

Before you report a problem you might want to read the [FAQ](faq.html).  
Whenever you are reporting a problem please be sure to include as much information as possible; the more we know the more chance of a quicker resolution.

*   Which [version](http://activemq.apache.org/download.html) of ActiveMQ
*   What platform of Java (e.g., Java SE 6 with JRE/[JDK](#) 1.6.0 or J2SE 5 with JRE/[JDK](#) 1.5.0)
*   Any particular application/web server or container being used - if so what version?
*   Stack traces generally really help! If in doubt include the whole thing; often exceptions get wrapped in other exceptions and the exception right near the bottom explains the actual error, not the first few lines at the top. It's very easy for us to skim-read past unnecessary parts of a stack trace.
*   Log output (e.g., `data/activemq.log`) can be useful too; sometimes [enabling DEBUG logging](how-do-i-change-the-logging.html) can help
*   Your code & configuration files are often useful

### How to get help faster

We can help you much quicker if you try the following

*   Provide us with a JUnit test case that demonstrates your issue. e.g. if you think you've found a bug, can you create a test case to demonstrate the bug?
*   [Submit a patch](contributing.html) fixing the bug! (We also buy you beer when we meet you if you submit bug fixes ![(smile)](https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/s/en_GB/5997/6f42626d00e36f53fe51440403446ca61552e2a2.1/_/images/icons/emoticons/smile.png) )
*   For memory leaks or performance related issues, if you can run a profiler on your test case and attach the output as a file (or zipped file if it's huge) to the JIRA we can normally fix things much faster. e.g. you could run [jmap](http://java.sun.com/j2se/1.5.0/docs/tooldocs/share/jmap.html)/[jhat](http://java.sun.com/javase/6/docs/technotes/tools/share/jhat.html), JProfiler or YourKit on your code and send us the output. To find memory leaks it's quicker to resolve if you can tell us what classes are taking up all of the RAM; we can normally figure out what's wrong from that.

Commercial Support
------------------

This is an open source project, so the amount of time we have available to help resolve your issue is often limited as all help is provided on a volunteer basis.
