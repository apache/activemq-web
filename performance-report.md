Performance guides
------------------

If you're not convinced by performance reports then please do try running performance tests yourself. You might wanna check out our overview of [Performance](performance.html) or try using out the [ActiveMQ Performance Module Users Manual](activemq-performance-module-users-manual.html)

The Commercial Providers on the [Support](support.html) page may also be able to help diagnose performance issues, suggest changes, etc...
