You follow these steps

1.  Create a durable topic subscription
2.  Kill the consumer
3.  Publish some messages to the topic
4.  Restart the subscriber

But you don't receive the messages?

### Fix

To be able to deliver messages to offline durable topic subscribers you must mark the message as being persistent. To do this set the PERSISTENT_DELIVERY mode on the MessageProducer as described [here](how-do-i-make-messages-durable.html).
