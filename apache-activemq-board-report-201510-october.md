**TLP Description:**

Apache ActiveMQ is a popular and powerful open source messaging server. Apache ActiveMQ is fast, supports many cross language clients and protocols, comes with easy to use enterprise integration patterns and many advanced features while fully supporting JMS 1.1, J2EE 1.4, AMQP 1.0.

**Activity: **

*   ActiveMQ 5 saw two new releases this quarter one major release and an additional bug fix release.
    *   ActiveMQ 5.11.2 was released on Mon Aug 10 2015
    *   ActiveMQ 5.12.0 was released on Thu Aug 13 2015
*   Some discussion on the mailing list around when to release ActiveMQ 5.12.1 and what fixes should be included. 
*   The ActiveMQ native clients also saw some releases this quarter and continue to see active development.
    *   ActiveMQ-CPP 3.9.0 was released on Sat Aug 15 2015
    *   The Apache.NMS API  v1.7.1 was released on Fri Sep 04 2015.

    *   ActiveMQ Artemis 1.1.0 was released on Wed Sep 23 2015

**Health Report:**

*   As the number and scope of the recent releases shows, there is a lot of development occurring throughout all of the ActiveMQ products 
*   Many bugs are being raised, but they are being looked at fairly promptly 
*   There were a couple of bugs raised that resulted in good “cross team” discussions as to whether the bug was, indeed, a bug or a desired change in behavior
*   While some of these discussions did hold up the creations of a patch release (5.12.1), it was important for the team to reach a consensus on the outcome and plans are starting to finish the release
